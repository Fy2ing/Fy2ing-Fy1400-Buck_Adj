## Description
This module can provide 3V~6V adjustable voltage output under a wide voltage input of 4.5V-18V, with a maximum output current of 10A. The input voltage of the module needs to be higher than the output voltage in order to function properly. Both input and output are equipped with power indicator lights, high-quality solid-state capacitors are selected, and heat dissipation fins are installed to ensure that the module can work stably and reliably for a long time; Equipped with M3 fixing holes for easy external fixation of modules.
